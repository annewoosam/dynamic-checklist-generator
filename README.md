The Dynamic Checklist system allows end-users to create their own checklists with the ability to add help prompts and link to video clips containing just-in-time refreshers of key training information.

As the preparer moves through the checklist, their answers are saved to a database and fed to the reviewer, who will be notified that the checklist is ready for use in review. The reviewer can fill out additional information that is saved to the database. If an item needs to be corrected, the reviewer can send a notification to the preparer. Both preparer and reviewer can see Kanban boards to keep track of what remains to be done based on the answers entered in teh question template.

Once an item is ready for delivery, the reviewer can send a notification to the person the work is being prepared for by adding or selecting him/her from a drop down list. A blind copy of the message can be made to a centralized inbox, allowing anyone who has access to the inbox to retrieve the e-mail and forward it as needed.

Finally, the checklist allows the reviewer to view reporting on which questions are currently marked for correction, so that appropriate training can be performed quickly.
